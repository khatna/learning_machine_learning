## Late to the ML party
But it's ok. Here are a few notebooks containing cool (subjective) things I did with Python & NumPy.

### Algorithm Implementations
1. [Linear Regression implementation using the GLM model with gradient descent](./glm-lr/glm-lr.ipynb)
2. [Handwritten digit recognition using k-nearest neighbors](./knn-mnist/knn-mnist.ipynb)

### Non-machine learning misc.
1. [Estimating pi with R and tidyverse](./estimate-pi/estimate_pi.pdf)
